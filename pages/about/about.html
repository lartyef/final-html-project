    <p>I am fiber optics engineer and aspiring developer, who loves to write and a football enthusiast. With a deep understanding of fiber optics technology, this individual possesses a keen eye for detail and a problem-solving attitude. When not working on fiber optic networks, you can find them honing their football skills or lost in the world of writing. Driven by a curiosity to learn and innovate, i am determined to pursue a career in software development and contribute to the world of technology.</p>
